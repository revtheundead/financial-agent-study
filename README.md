# Finance AI Agents Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook provides an implementation of **AI-powered financial analysis agents**. It is designed to automate various financial tasks such as web-based financial data retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for financial documents, stock market analysis, and response evaluation.

## Features
- **Agent 1: Web Search Agent** – Retrieves financial news and stock data using external tools.
- **Agent 2: RAG-Based Knowledge Agent** – Queries a vector database for financial documents and generates answers.
- **Agent 3: Stock Market Analysis Agent** – Uses Yahoo Finance to compare stock performance and generate reports.
- **Agent 4: LLM-as-a-Judge** – Evaluates responses from other agents for accuracy and coherence.
